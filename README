To run the server:
  open the root folder of this in a terminal
  cd into NodeServer
  run 'node app.js'


To connect with the client:
  For running my client: 
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/r83rmle6trjn7at/movementFPS-updater.zip?dl=1
  
  For running your changed client:
    build the unity game and run it
    change the port in the main menu to what the server is running on (look at app.js, is 4000 if you don't change it)
    change the address in the main menu to the ip of the server
      if it is local (not on the same machine), type 'ipconfig' on the server hoster and use the IPv4 address, or look at your router stuff
      if it is local (and on the same machine), use 'localhost'
      if it not local, just enter the ip address of the server
